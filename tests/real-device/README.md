# Real-device isolated LAN smoke test

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

This guide is for the first real-device milestone after the virtual LAN lab has
passed. The goal is to validate the same macOS gateway implementation with
physical clients while keeping the test network isolated from the home or office
LAN.

## Core topology

Yes: the core idea is to give the Mac a dedicated downstream LAN interface. Test
devices join only that downstream LAN, while another Mac interface remains the
upstream Internet path.

```text
Home router / main Wi-Fi
        ^
        |
   Mac Wi-Fi en0
        |
   omg + mihomo + dnsmasq + pf
        |
   Mac USB Ethernet en7: 192.168.50.1
        v
   Test switch / spare router in AP or bridge mode
        v
   iPhone / PS5 / Switch / test laptop
```

In this topology the home router's DHCP server can remain enabled because it is
on a different broadcast domain. The project's dnsmasq instance is configured to
bind to the downstream interface only, so its DHCP broadcasts should stay on
`en7` and should not appear on the main Wi-Fi.

Never run this project's DHCP server on the main home or office LAN.

## Hardware requirements

- A Mac with one upstream interface, normally Wi-Fi such as `en0`.
- A separate downstream interface, normally a USB Ethernet adapter such as `en7`.
- A test switch, or a spare router configured as AP/bridge mode.
- One test laptop, plus one or more devices such as iPhone, PS5, or Switch.

The spare router must not run DHCP, NAT, firewall, or router mode for this test.
It should only bridge Wi-Fi/Ethernet clients onto the Mac's downstream LAN.

## Preflight

Run the virtual LAN gates first:

```sh
make lab-up
sudo -v
make lab-test
make lab-test-tun
make lab-down
```

Identify the Mac interfaces:

```sh
networksetup -listallhardwareports
route -n get default
ifconfig en7
```

Expected:

- `upstream_interface` is the interface that reaches the Internet, for example
  `en0`.
- `gateway.interface` is the downstream test LAN, for example `en7`.
- The two interfaces must be different.
- The upstream network must not already use `192.168.50.0/24`.

Prefer the smoke runner for local config generation, build, downstream address
binding, root doctor, startup, and basic probes:

```sh
make real-device-start-off
make real-device-status
```

The runner prompts for `sudo` once in the terminal and keeps the root-required
steps inside that same sudo session. It does not install a passwordless sudoers
rule, and it does not grant passwordless root access to writable binaries in the
repository.

If the downstream interface is not `en7`, override it:

```sh
OMG_REAL_DEVICE_IFACE=en8 make real-device-start-off
```

The manual flow is still available:

```sh
sudo ifconfig en7 inet 192.168.50.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

## Configs

Create local configs under `runtime/real-device/`. Keep these files out of
commits if they contain machine-specific interface names or proxy settings.
The example below assumes commands are run from the repository root.

Use explicit proxy mode first:

```yaml
gateway:
  interface: "en7"
  lan_ip: "192.168.50.1"
  upstream_interface: "en0"

dhcp:
  binary: "./runtime/tools/bin/dnsmasq"
  enabled: true
  range_start: "192.168.50.100"
  range_end: "192.168.50.200"
  lease_time: "30m"
  domain: "realtest"

dns:
  listen: "192.168.50.1"
  port: 53
  upstream: ""

mihomo:
  binary: "./runtime/tools/bin/mihomo"
  config: "./runtime/real-device/mihomo.yaml"
  mixed_port: 17890
  redir_port: 0
  api_addr: "127.0.0.1:19090"
  secret: ""

pf:
  anchor_name: "com.apple/open_mihomo_gateway_real_device"
  redirect_tcp_to: 0

transparent:
  mode: "off"
  tun_device: "utun123"
  tun_stack: "mixed"
  tun_auto_route: true
  tun_auto_detect_interface: false
  tun_strict_route: false

runtime:
  dir: "./runtime/real-device"
```

For transparent TUN mode, copy that config and change only these fields:

```yaml
dns:
  listen: "192.168.50.1"
  port: 53
  upstream: "127.0.0.1#1053"

transparent:
  mode: "tun"
```

By default, the generated mihomo config uses `MATCH,DIRECT`. That mode proves
that real-device traffic is captured and forwarded by the Mac gateway. To prove
proxy egress behavior, enable the optional `upstream_proxy` section and point it
at a controlled HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy:

```yaml
upstream_proxy:
  enabled: true
  name: "real-device-egress"
  type: "http"
  server: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 18080
  username: ""
  password: ""
  match_domain: "example.com"
```

The proxy may run on the Mac itself. Keep it disabled for the default DIRECT
gateway smoke.

## Explicit proxy smoke

Recommended startup:

```sh
make real-device-start-off
```

The runner builds, writes `runtime/real-device/config-off.yaml`, binds the
downstream address, runs root doctor, starts the gateway, and performs basic
DNS/API/listener probes.

Manual build and startup:

```sh
GOCACHE=/private/tmp/omg-go-cache go build -o bin/omg ./cmd/omg
sudo ./bin/omg doctor --config runtime/real-device/config-off.yaml
sudo ./bin/omg start --config runtime/real-device/config-off.yaml
./bin/omg status --config runtime/real-device/config-off.yaml
./bin/omg leases --config runtime/real-device/config-off.yaml
```

Connect the test laptop and devices to the downstream AP. The laptop should get
an address such as `192.168.50.100`, with router and DNS set to `192.168.50.1`.

On the test laptop:

```sh
route -n get default
dig @192.168.50.1 example.com A
curl --noproxy '*' --fail --show-error https://example.com/
curl --proxy http://192.168.50.1:17890 --fail --show-error https://example.com/
```

### Physical phone: no-proxy direct HTTPS/NAT

Keep `make real-device-start-off` running. In the phone Wi-Fi details, turn HTTP
proxy off; if needed, temporarily disable cellular data so the phone cannot fall
back to it. Confirm the phone address is `192.168.50.x`, with router/DNS set to
`192.168.50.1`.

Open a simple HTTPS page on the phone, for example `https://example.com/`. Then
run this on the Mac:

```sh
make real-device-client-check
```

Expected: the phone can load the page, `leases` shows the phone or equivalent
physical client, and `dnsmasq.log` shows queries from the downstream client.
This proves smoke-level direct HTTPS through Mac NAT in explicit/off mode. It
does not prove mihomo proxy egress because the client is not using an explicit
proxy and transparent mode is not enabled yet.

### Physical phone: explicit HTTP proxy HTTPS

Keep `make real-device-start-off` running. In the phone Wi-Fi settings, set HTTP
proxy to manual:

```text
Server: 192.168.50.1
Port: 17890
```

Open `https://example.com/` again, or another simple HTTPS page. Then run this
on the Mac:

```sh
make real-device-client-check
tail -n 120 runtime/real-device/logs/mihomo.log
```

Expected: the phone can load the HTTPS page. If the current log level records
connections, `mihomo.log` should show a TCP connection from the phone
`192.168.50.x` address to a target such as `example.com:443`. After explicit
proxy testing, turn HTTP proxy off in the phone Wi-Fi settings before testing
direct or TUN mode.

Stop and verify cleanup:

```sh
make real-device-stop
```

`make real-device-stop` stops both real-device configs and removes the
`192.168.50.1` test LAN address from the downstream interface when it is still
present. This keeps the virtual LAN lab from later routing `192.168.50.0/24`
traffic to the real-device interface.

Or manually:

```sh
sudo ./bin/omg stop --config runtime/real-device/config-off.yaml
./bin/omg status --config runtime/real-device/config-off.yaml
sysctl -n net.inet.ip.forwarding
sudo pfctl -s Anchors
```

## Transparent TUN smoke

Recommended TUN startup:

```sh
make real-device-start-tun
```

Or manually:

```sh
sudo ./bin/omg start --config runtime/real-device/config-tun.yaml
./bin/omg status --config runtime/real-device/config-tun.yaml
./bin/omg leases --config runtime/real-device/config-tun.yaml
```

Leave clients without explicit proxy settings. From the test laptop:

```sh
dig @192.168.50.1 example.com A
curl --noproxy '*' --fail --show-error https://example.com/
```

On a physical phone, first confirm Wi-Fi HTTP proxy is off, then reconnect to
the downstream AP or renew DHCP. Open `https://example.com/` or another simple
HTTPS page. This differs from the explicit proxy test: the phone must not use
`192.168.50.1:17890`, otherwise the run does not prove the TUN transparent path.

On the Mac, confirm mihomo saw client traffic:

```sh
make real-device-client-check
tail -n 120 runtime/real-device/logs/mihomo.log
```

Expected: the phone can load the HTTPS page, and the log contains a TCP
connection from a real client address such as `192.168.50.100` to
`example.com:443`, or to the target used during the smoke test. Only after this
signal appears should the real-device TUN smoke be called verified.

## Proxy egress smoke

Start a controlled local HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy first. The default runner values
expect an HTTP proxy on `127.0.0.1:18080`; override the environment variables
when using another host, port, type, or test domain.

```sh
make real-device-start-tun-proxy
```

Equivalent explicit invocation:

```sh
OMG_REAL_DEVICE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_ENABLED=true \
OMG_REAL_DEVICE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_TYPE=http \
OMG_REAL_DEVICE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_SERVER=127.0.0.1 \
OMG_REAL_DEVICE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_PORT=18080 \
OMG_REAL_DEVICE_UPSTREAM_PROXY_MATCH_DOMAIN=example.com \
make real-device-start-tun
```

Leave the phone without explicit proxy settings and open
`https://example.com/`. Then inspect both OpenSurge and the controlled proxy:

```sh
make real-device-client-check
tail -n 120 runtime/real-device/logs/mihomo.log
```

Expected: `dnsmasq.log` shows the real client resolving the match domain through
mihomo fake-ip, `mihomo.log` shows the match domain using `open-surge-egress`
rather than `DIRECT`, and the controlled proxy log shows the corresponding
egress request. If the controlled proxy has a distinct external route, also
compare the observed exit IP.

Stop and verify cleanup:

```sh
make real-device-stop
```

`make real-device-stop` stops both real-device configs and removes the
`192.168.50.1` test LAN address from the downstream interface when it is still
present. This keeps the virtual LAN lab from later routing `192.168.50.0/24`
traffic to the real-device interface.

Or manually:

```sh
sudo ./bin/omg stop --config runtime/real-device/config-tun.yaml
./bin/omg status --config runtime/real-device/config-tun.yaml
sysctl -n net.inet.ip.forwarding
sudo pfctl -s Anchors
```

## Acceptance checklist

- The main home or office network remains unaffected.
- DHCP leases are issued only to devices on the downstream test LAN.
- Test laptop receives `192.168.50.x`, router `192.168.50.1`, and DNS
  `192.168.50.1`.
- Direct HTTPS works through NAT in explicit proxy mode.
- Explicit HTTPS through `192.168.50.1:17890` works.
- TUN mode works without client proxy settings.
- `mihomo.log` shows real client traffic in TUN mode.
- Proxy egress smoke shows `open-surge-egress` instead of `DIRECT` for the
  matched domain.
- `stop` removes runtime state, unloads the pf anchor, and releases the
  downstream test LAN IP.
- IP forwarding is restored to its previous value after `stop`.

## Artifact checklist

Create one artifact directory per run:

```sh
mkdir -p artifacts/real-device/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

Save:

- `config-off.yaml` and `config-tun.yaml`.
- `host-before.txt`: `route -n get default`, downstream `ifconfig`, pf anchors,
  and `sysctl -n net.inet.ip.forwarding`.
- `doctor-off.txt` and `doctor-tun.txt`.
- `start-off.log` and `start-tun.log`.
- `status-during.txt` and `leases.txt`.
- `mihomo.log`.
- `client-laptop.txt`: route, DNS, curl results.
- `client-devices.md`: device model, IP, router/DNS, explicit proxy result, TUN
  result.
- `host-after.txt`: status, pf anchors, forwarding, and any leftover processes.

## Abort conditions

Stop immediately and collect diagnostics if any of these happen:

- A non-test device on the main LAN receives `192.168.50.x`.
- The Mac upstream interface and downstream interface are the same.
- The spare router is still running DHCP or NAT.
- The upstream network already uses `192.168.50.0/24`.
- `stop` fails to unload the pf anchor or restore IP forwarding.
- Client traffic works only through the router's own NAT instead of through the
  Mac gateway.
