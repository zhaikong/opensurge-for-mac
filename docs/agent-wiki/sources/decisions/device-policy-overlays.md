# Per-device policies are compiled into one mihomo instance

OpenSurge for Mac does not start a separate proxy engine or carry a full
mihomo profile for every LAN device. A device-policy JSON file records stable
device identity as MAC plus a reserved IPv4 lease, then compiles a device's
rules into one shared mihomo configuration.

Each registered device chooses an explicit egress mode. `inherit_global` keeps
device overrides but sends unmatched traffic through the global rules and
terminal `MATCH`. `dedicated` receives a `device/<id>/default` selector and
places that selector before global rules for public-Internet traffic; source-
scoped local/private/link-local/CGNAT/multicast guards remain `DIRECT`. A rule with
its own `policies` receives a separate `device/<id>/<rule-id>` selector. The
compiled mihomo rules use IPv4 `SRC-IP-CIDR` so a selection changes only the
specified device. `devices` reports configured identities and lease state;
`device-policy-select` only accepts selectors belonging to the named device.

An old document with no `egress_mode` resolves to `legacy_fallback`: overrides
before global rules, then the historical device default after global rules and
before terminal `MATCH`. This compatibility state is readable but is not the
default for new GUI registrations; the GUI asks the operator to choose an
explicit mode rather than silently changing routing.

An inherit-only profile may retain `default_policies` for a future mode change,
but those candidates are not rendered or added to imported-target validation
unless a dedicated or legacy device actually creates the default selector.

Rules may combine domain, IP CIDR, TCP/UDP protocol, port, and rule-provider
conditions. Populated condition types are ANDed, while values inside one type
are ORed into separate mihomo rules. Small lists use inline rule-providers;
large shared lists may use HTTP providers. HTTP MRS is valid only for domain
and ipcidr behavior. OpenSurge ships no household templates or third-party
rule content; templates and rule-set URLs are operator-owned data.

Order is part of the contract: device overrides precede global rules in every
mode; a dedicated device default also precedes global rules, while an inherited
device has no default selector. An imported profile's terminal `MATCH` stays
last. Reject an imported profile with rules after `MATCH`.

The supported identity boundary is MAC-backed IPv4 DHCP reservations plus
`SRC-IP-CIDR`. It is not IPv6 identity or MAC matching performed inside mihomo.
Registered addresses must stay in the gateway `/24` and cannot be its network,
broadcast, gateway, or declared protected address. same-Wi-Fi DHCP start also
rejects a reservation when ARP observes a different MAC at that IPv4; no ARP
reply is only an inconclusive signal, not proof of vacancy.

The configured policy is desired state. One start compiles it exactly once into
an immutable bundle, validates the final mihomo configuration before forwarding
is enabled, and saves the bundle plus digest as runtime applied state. Running
`devices` and `device-policy-select` consume that applied snapshot; a changed
or invalid desired file is surfaced as drift/error rather than reinterpreting a
running gateway. A healthy running gateway may apply a saved desired policy
through `reload`: compile and validate the complete candidate in an isolated
temporary runtime, including real `mihomo -t`, then perform one full stop/start
with that same immutable config. Validation failure leaves the current gateway
untouched. Reload is interrupting and is not a zero-downtime hot swap.

The Web GUI defaults ordinary device registration to `inherit_global`, exposes
routing mode as a save-and-reload choice, and displays a live default selector
only for an applied dedicated/legacy device. It creates a private
`<device-id>-policy` profile. On the first main-path edit of a shared or
template-derived profile, it copies the resolved effective content to a
template-free private profile and changes only that device reference.

A device may also carry human-readable `name` metadata with spaces or Unicode.
Its technical `id` remains restricted and stable because it is part of the
generated mihomo selector namespace. The GUI derives a collision-free ID for a
new display name and preserves the ID on later renames; older policies fall back
to displaying the ID. Dashboard lease and traffic views join this registered
name by normalized MAC and prefer it over a DHCP hostname.

Mihomo may continue rule evaluation for UDP when a selected outbound lacks UDP
support. Generated selector/default rules therefore add a same-condition
`REJECT` fallback by default; `on_unsupported: fallthrough` is an explicit
opt-out. Imported profiles are parsed as YAML for namespace/reference checks:
generated `device/` groups and `open-surge-ruleset-` providers are reserved,
and candidates/actions must reference known targets or explicit built-ins.

Use `make test` for the compiler, JSON validation, template, and rule-provider
coverage. Use `make lab-test-tun-device-policy` for data-path changes to
reservations, independent per-device selectors, or device overrides. That Lab
gate proves two VM clients receive `.101` and `.102`, compares dedicated egress
against inherited global `MATCH`, confirms inherited mode has no default slot,
then reloads it to dedicated mode, chooses different TUN egress paths without
affecting the other device, enforces a device-specific IP `REJECT`, preserves
exact applied DHCP identities, exposes desired/applied drift,
apply that drift through the real `omg reload`, reconverge the digests while the
gateway returns to running, and fail close UDP/443 through an HTTP-only selected
outbound.
