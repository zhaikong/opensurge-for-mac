# Per-device policy overlays

OpenSurge runs one mihomo process. Device policy does not create a mihomo
process or a complete profile per client. Instead, OpenSurge assigns a stable
IPv4 lease to each registered MAC address, generates an independent selector
group for every device, and routes traffic with mihomo `SRC-IP-CIDR` rules.

This feature is optional. Point `device_policy.file` at a JSON document; the
empty [starter document](../examples/device-policy.example.json) is valid but
does not enable any device policy.

```yaml
device_policy:
  file: "./devices.json"
```

The device-policy file is resolved relative to the gateway configuration file.
All registered IPv4 addresses must be unique, must remain in the gateway `/24`,
and must not be the network, broadcast, or `gateway.lan_ip` address.

For `same_wifi_dhcp`, declare every router, recovery client, LAN proxy, or
other static address that must never become a reservation:

```yaml
device_policy:
  file: "./devices.json"
  protected_ipv4: "192.168.1.1,192.168.1.21,192.168.1.101"
```

Reservations may be inside the dynamic DHCP range; `devices --format json`
marks that relation explicitly. A reservation may not equal a protected
address. At same-Wi-Fi DHCP start, OpenSurge also warms ARP and refuses a
reservation when a different MAC is already observed. No ARP reply is not a
guarantee that an address is vacant, so router-DHCP isolation and recovery
evidence remain required.

## Model

There are no built-in household, parental-control, streaming, or vendor rule
lists. Operators own the policy content. The JSON model has four independent
collections:

- `devices`: stable identity (`id`, MAC, reserved IPv4, profile id), an optional
  human-readable `name`, plus an explicit `egress_mode`;
- `profiles`: default selector candidates plus device rule overlays;
- `templates`: optional reusable profile defaults and rule fragments;
- `rule_sets`: inline or HTTP mihomo rule-provider definitions.

The following is a syntax example only. `Proxy` must already exist in the
managed or imported global mihomo profile.

```json
{
  "templates": [
    {
      "id": "baseline",
      "default_policies": ["DIRECT", "Proxy"]
    }
  ],
  "rule_sets": [
    {
      "id": "media",
      "behavior": "domain",
      "payload": ["media.example"]
    }
  ],
  "profiles": [
    {
      "id": "phone",
      "template": "baseline",
      "rules": [
        {
          "id": "block-udp",
          "match": {"protocols": ["udp"]},
          "action": "REJECT"
        },
        {
          "id": "media",
          "match": {"rule_sets": ["media"]},
          "policies": ["Proxy", "DIRECT"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "alice-phone",
      "name": "Alice Phone",
      "mac": "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01",
      "ipv4": "192.168.50.101",
      "profile": "phone",
      "egress_mode": "dedicated"
    }
  ]
}
```

`name` is display metadata and may contain spaces or Unicode characters. The
stable `id` remains limited to letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens
because it is used in generated selector names such as
`device/<device-id>/default`. The Web GUI accepts the display name and creates
a collision-free technical ID automatically; changing the display name of an
existing device does not change its ID. Older documents without `name` display
the device ID as their name.

`egress_mode` is either:

- `inherit_global`: device overrides remain active, then unmatched traffic
  follows the same global rules and terminal `MATCH` used by the Mac;
- `dedicated`: unmatched public-Internet traffic uses the device-owned
  `device/<device-id>/default` selector before global rules. Local, private,
  link-local, CGNAT, and multicast destinations remain `DIRECT`.

New devices created in the Web GUI default to `inherit_global`. A document that
omits `egress_mode` keeps the previous global-first/device-fallback behavior as
`legacy_fallback`; the GUI displays that state explicitly and asks the operator
to choose either new mode instead of silently migrating it.

An inherit-only device retains its profile's `default_policies` as future
configuration, but those unused candidates are not rendered or checked against
the current imported profile until a dedicated/legacy device actually needs
that selector.

For `dedicated` (and legacy compatibility), `default_policies` creates
`device/<device-id>/default`. A rule with
`policies` creates a separately selectable group named
`device/<device-id>/<rule-id>`. A rule with `action` routes directly to a
built-in policy such as `DIRECT` or `REJECT`, or to an existing global mihomo
group.

Policy candidates and actions are checked against the imported profile's
proxy/group namespace before start. `DIRECT`, `REJECT`, `REJECT-DROP`, and
`REJECT-TINYGIF` are the explicit built-ins. OpenSurge reserves `device/` for
generated groups and `open-surge-ruleset-` for generated rule providers, so an
imported profile may not occupy those namespaces.

## Matching and precedence

`domains`, `ip_cidrs`, `protocols` (`tcp` or `udp`), `ports`, and `rule_sets`
can be combined. Different populated fields are ANDed; entries within one field
are ORed and compile to separate mihomo rules. For example, a domain and a
protocol compile to:

```text
AND,((SRC-IP-CIDR,192.168.50.101/32),(DOMAIN-SUFFIX,media.example),(NETWORK,tcp)),device/alice-phone/media
```

Generated ordering is deliberate. All modes put device-specific overrides
before global rules. `inherit_global` then continues through global rules and
the terminal `MATCH`. `dedicated` adds source-scoped local/private `DIRECT`
guards first, followed by device overrides, the device default selector,
global rules, and the terminal `MATCH`. A legacy document keeps its historical
device default after global rules and before `MATCH`.

An imported profile must keep `MATCH` terminal. OpenSurge rejects an imported
profile that places later rules after a terminal `MATCH`, because the device
default could never be reached safely.

## UDP unsupported-outbound behavior

Mihomo continues downward when UDP selects an outbound that does not support
UDP. Device selectors therefore compile as fail-closed by default: every
selector/default rule is immediately followed by the same condition with
`REJECT`. This prevents QUIC or other UDP traffic from silently reaching a
later global rule or `MATCH,DIRECT`.

Set `on_unsupported: "fallthrough"` on a profile, template, or individual
rule only when a later rule is intentionally responsible for that fallback.
The default is `"reject"`. A proxy/group name being present does not prove UDP
capability; provider-backed candidates require live traffic evidence.

## Large rule sets and templates

`rule_sets` support `inline` and `http` providers with `domain`, `ipcidr`, or
`classical` behavior. HTTP providers may use `yaml`, `text`, or `mrs`; mihomo
MRS is accepted only for `domain` and `ipcidr` behavior. Use an HTTP MRS set for
large shared domain/IP lists, and use profile templates to reuse policy choices
without cloning a full mihomo profile.

## Operations

```sh
./bin/omg devices --config ./config.yaml --format json

./bin/omg device-policy-select \
  --config ./config.yaml \
  --device alice-phone \
  --slot default \
  --policy Proxy
```

The second command changes only the named device selector. It does not switch
another device's selector or the global policy group. The `default` slot exists
only for an applied `dedicated` device or a legacy compatibility device;
`inherit_global` intentionally has no default selector.

To apply a saved desired policy while the gateway is already running:

```sh
sudo ./bin/omg reload --config ./config.yaml
sudo ./bin/omg reload --config ./config.yaml --format json
```

`reload` first renders all generated artifacts into an isolated temporary
runtime, checks interfaces, protected/reserved IPv4 conflicts, and runs the
real `mihomo -t`. A validation failure leaves the current gateway running. Only
after validation succeeds does OpenSurge perform the normal full stop/start
lifecycle; this is interrupting reload, not a zero-downtime service hot swap.

## Desired and applied policy

`start` compiles the policy once, renders DHCP and mihomo from that same
immutable bundle, validates mihomo before forwarding is enabled, and writes
`runtime/device-policy.applied.json` plus its digest in `runtime/state.json`.
`devices` and `device-policy-select` use that applied snapshot while the
gateway is running. `devices` compares the current desired digest and reports
`drift`; an invalid desired file is returned as `desired_error` without hiding
the running applied policy.

Editing `devices.json` does not reload the gateway automatically. Use `reload`
when a healthy gateway is running, or let the desired policy apply on the next
normal `start`. Stale lease rows for a managed MAC with the old reserved IPv4
are removed at startup; wait for a fresh DHCP ACK before testing policy traffic.

The Web GUI separates these semantics: applied selector choices are green and
immediate; device identity, routing mode, selector membership, and rule edits
are yellow and require save plus reload. Only an applied `dedicated` device
shows the live default selector; an inherited device shows that it is following
global rules. The device path creates a private `<device-id>-policy` profile by
default. On the first edit of a shared or template-derived profile, the GUI
copies its resolved effective content into a template-free private profile and
changes only that device reference.

`same_lan` manual-gateway mode does not run OpenSurge DHCP. In that mode the
Devices page extracts source IPv4 addresses in the gateway `/24` from current
mihomo connections and best-effort joins MAC addresses from the macOS ARP cache.
Those clients appear under "currently passing through Mac" for registration.
Dashboard device traffic combines DHCP leases, applied static devices, and
currently observed same-LAN source IPv4 addresses, so registered static devices
retain names, traffic rates, counters, and egress attribution while active
unregistered sources appear as temporary devices. Traffic and ARP observations
are not DHCP identity proof; an unresolved MAC still requires manual input, and
the main router must keep the registered IPv4 stable.

Dashboard traffic and recent-lease summaries join the registered display name
by normalized MAC and prefer it over the DHCP hostname. This makes a saved
device name visible even when the client does not publish a DHCP hostname.

`lease_active` means only that dnsmasq has an unexpired lease. It is not a
reachability claim. `policy_identity_ready` is true only when the gateway is
using an applied policy and the lease MAC, IPv4, and expiry all match the
applied reservation.

## Validation boundary

The feature still enforces device policy through IPv4 `SRC-IP-CIDR` rules. DHCP
mode provides exact MAC-backed lease evidence; `same_lan` provides separate
static-registration, active-traffic, and optional ARP-neighbor observations and
does not present them as DHCP verification. It does not provide IPv6 device
identity, MAC matching inside mihomo, or curated third-party rule content.

The required data-plane gate is:

```sh
make lab-up
sudo -v
make lab-test-tun-device-policy
make lab-down
```

It uses two Lima clients, verifies the fixed `.101` and `.102` leases, proves
one dedicated device takes its selector before global `MATCH`, proves one
inherited device follows global `MATCH` without exposing a default selector,
then reloads the inherited device into dedicated mode and verifies independent
selector changes and a device-specific IP `REJECT`. It creates desired drift, calls the real
`omg reload`, requires the gateway to remain running and desired/applied digests
to converge, then rechecks independent selectors and the new rule. It also
asserts exact DHCP identity and that UDP/443 over an HTTP-only egress is logged
as `REJECT` rather than falling through to `DIRECT`. Rule/template/provider
compilation is covered by unit tests and does not require a Lab run for each
operator-defined rule.
